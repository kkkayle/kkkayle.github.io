## AI predicts protein structure: a new milestone in drug development

Cancer, as one of the diseases that are difficult to cure for humans, takes many lives every day. With the development of life sciences, more and more scientists are committed to studying anti-cancer drugs to save more lives. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has played a very important role in the field of drug discovery. It is expected to accurately identify target proteins and develop anti-cancer drugs with unimaginable efficiency. As we all know, David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John M. Jumper won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the theme of AI protein structure prediction (Nobel Prize Outreach, 2024). The AI tool is AlphaFold. It accurately predicts protein structure through deep learning models. It used to take a lot of time for researchers to analyze a protein structure, but AlphaFold only takes a few minutes on a computing cluster to predict hundreds of thousands of proteins, which completely changed structural biology. Why is protein structure so important for drug development? Because understanding the three-dimensional shape of the protein structure is equivalent to telling us the design blueprint of the protein, which allows us to know how to intervene in the protein. Many cancers are caused by abnormal protein function or abnormal signaling pathways. By accurately predicting these structures, researchers can understand the molecular mechanism of the disease and design drugs that precisely match the protein pocket. To use a common example, it is like knowing the shape of the keyhole (protein), we can design the corresponding key (drug). In addition to AlphaFold, LLMs represented by ChatGPT are also widely used in the field of bioinformatics due to their strong generalization ability and interpretability, and more and more drug research on LLMs is underway, which may completely change the paradigm of drug development. However, the rapid development of these models has brought new opportunities, but their credibility and ethical issues have also attracted some challenges and controversies. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Expansion and Core Challenges of LLM Applications

The development of large language models (LLMs) has brought both benefits and drawbacks to AI-driven anticancer drug discovery (Chakraborty et al., 2025). Wei et al. (2024), a bioinformatics research team from Wenzhou University of Technology and related institutions, focused on drug repositioning and proposed the DrugReAlign framework for predicting drug‑target interactions using LLMs. Their study conducted molecular docking experiments and evaluated recall on large‑scale benchmark datasets to demonstrate that LLMs, when paired with domain‑specific prompts and molecular knowledge, can perform competitively or even outperform traditional models. Their study showed the application prospects of LLMs in the field of targeted drug development and proved its practical feasibility in real‑world scenarios through verification (Wei et al., 2024). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Building on the work of Wei et al., Chakraborty et al. (2025), a research team from the Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Adamas University, discussed a wider range of applications, classifying the roles of LLMs into structured drug design, new drug design, and ADMET research. Specifically, structured drug design refers to optimizing known drug‑target interactions using structural and sequence data; new drug design focuses on generating novel molecules with therapeutic potential; and ADMET research involves predicting pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles to assess drug safety and efficacy (Chakraborty et al., 2025). They strongly agreed with Wei et al.’s (2024) view that LLMs can simplify traditional and labor‑intensive processes, but they also emphasized the “hallucination” problem—where models may generate biologically inaccurate or plausible‑sounding but incorrect drug‑target interactions or compound suggestions (Chakraborty et al., 2025). This issue affects the trustworthiness of the model in high‑stakes drug discovery tasks and points out the need for human‑in‑the‑loop systems and better domain grounding of AI outputs. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

Chen et al. (2023), an AIDD Lab team from Mindrank AI Ltd., also contributed to this research from another dimension—that of biomedical text generation and information extraction. They analyzed the performance of LLMs in biomedical text generation, which plays a very important role in completing clinical data‑driven tasks. They showed that ChatGPT performed well in several benchmark tasks, but struggled with factual consistency and domain‑specific reasoning (Chen et al., 2023), further raising concerns about LLM reliability noted by Chakraborty et al. (2025). Notably, their benchmarks provided a clear framework for evaluating and comparing LLMs, offering a roadmap for future improvements (Chen et al., 2023). Their contribution to the performance evaluation of ChatGPT in relation extraction and text extraction not only shows empirical support for the need for trustworthy model construction proposed by Chakraborty’s team, but also shows consistent practical feasibility with Wei et al. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## Industry and Policy Intensification: Accelerating the Implementation of AI Drug Development

In addition to academia, industry and government have also begun to invest heavily in the application of artificial intelligence in anti‑cancer drug development. For example, Isomorphic Labs (2025), a subsidiary of DeepMind, recently raised \$600 million to accelerate AI‑driven drug design in an attempt to apply LLM‑designed therapies to clinical trials with cancer as the main target. The investment scale of this project is huge, and it also shows that the industry is very confident in the potential of LLMs in drug development (Isomorphic Labs, 2025). In addition, the US “Stargate” project is a \$500 billion private sector program involving companies such as OpenAI and Oracle, reflecting a national strategic vision to use artificial intelligence (including LLMs) to solve major health challenges (CBS News, 2025). Specific applications include personalized cancer vaccines and early cancer detection. These advances interact with technological advances in academia, accelerating the development of anti‑cancer drug pipelines based on LLMs, and also showing that they are very confident in this direction. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## A Future of Opportunities and Challenges

Overall, these three studies form a highly integrated view: Wei et al. (2024) demonstrated and proved the feasibility of the model in a specific application (drug repositioning), Chakraborty et al. (2025) provided a broader overview, including classification and limitations, while Chen et al. (2023) evaluated the basic capabilities of LLMs in medical text understanding. Combined with the progress of programs such as Isomorphic Labs and Stargate in the real world at the industrial and policy levels, this shows that LLMs have made great progress at this stage, although there are still many problems, including but not limited to the “hallucination phenomenon” and fact‑based reasoning issues. However, industry, academia, and policy have all expressed their expectations for LLMs in anti‑cancer drug development and have invested significant resources into these projects. These are very positive signals. I believe that a drug development pipeline based on LLMs will truly emerge in the future. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
