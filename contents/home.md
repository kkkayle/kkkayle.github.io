#### About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m **Jinhang Wei**, a senior undergraduate student at the **University of Minnesota, Twin Cities**. I am also working as a remote research assistant at the [University of Florida](https://yanjun-li.com/). My research interests lie at the intersection of **Deep Learning** and **Life Sciences**, with a particular focus on **AI-driven Drug Discovery (AIDD)**.

I have published papers as the first author in several high-impact journals, including:

- *J. Phys. Chem. Lett.* (Cover Article, Nature Index)
- *BMC Biol.*
- *Brief Bioinform.*
- *IEEE J. Biomed. Health*, and more.
